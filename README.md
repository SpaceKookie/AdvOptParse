Python options parser
==========

This is a library that provices enhanced functionality to python by adding a parser for commandline arguments, including but not limited to options (e.g. '-v'), data fields (e.g. 'file=/path/to/file') as well as sub-command fields ands scopes (e.g.'git clone')

It also adds support for chaining commands and options such as they are being executed sequentially. (e.g. 'git add * commit -m "Some message" push)

Check later for instructions on how to use this.
